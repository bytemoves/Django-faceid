# Django Face ID Login Project

## Overview

The Django Face ID Login Project is a web application that allows users to securely authenticate using facial recognition technology. Instead of traditional username and password combinations, this project leverages facial biometrics to provide a seamless and secure login experience. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting it up.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition Login**: Users can log in by capturing a photo of their face using their device's camera. The system compares the captured image to the stored facial features to grant access.

- **User Registration**: New users can register by providing their personal information and capturing their facial features during the registration process.

- **User Management**: Admins can manage users, including creating, updating, and deleting user accounts.

- **Secure Data Storage**: User data and facial features are securely stored in the database, with appropriate encryption and hashing for sensitive information.

- **User Access Control**: Role-based access control, where admins have additional privileges for managing users and system settings.

- **User Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, change passwords, and manage account settings.

- **Responsive Design**: The web application is designed to work on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Django Face ID Login Project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed
- Django framework
- A database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Webcam or camera for capturing facial images

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Django Face ID Login Project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytemoves/Django-faceid.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Database**:

   Update the database settings in the `settings.py` file to connect to your preferred database system. By default, it uses SQLite for development purposes.

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
           'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Apply Migrations**:

   Run the following commands to apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create Superuser** (Admin Account):

   Create an admin account to access the admin interface:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**:

   Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The web application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

8. **Access the Admin Interface**:

   Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in using the admin credentials you created in step 6. Here, you can manage users and configure system settings.

9. **User Registration and Authentication**:

   Users can register by going to `http://localhost:8000/register/`. After registration, they can log in using the facial recognition feature on the login page.

## Additional Configuration

- **Camera Integration**: To enable facial recognition, you'll need to integrate with a camera or webcam. Consider using Python libraries like OpenCV for capturing images.

- **User Roles and Permissions**: You can define different user roles and permissions according to your project requirements using Django's built-in authentication and authorization system.

- **Security Enhancements**: Enhance the security of the application by implementing features like two-factor authentication and thorough input validation.

## Conclusion

The Django Face ID Login Project is a powerful and secure solution for user authentication and registration using facial recognition technology. By following these setup instructions, you can deploy the application and customize it to meet your specific requirements. Enjoy the benefits of a password-free, biometric authentication system in your Django web application.
